        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> My interest for chazzanus came about 3 years ago when I heard the cantors voices, and songs from the Golden Age of Chazzanus. Before these three years, I had heard more modern cantorial music, from this generation, and didn't think much of it, so i didn't further look into the genre of music because I thought the rest would sound more modern. Turns out I was wrong. I became really attached to this genre, and I found the spirituality of the older music pierced my soul. I continue to listen, and grow my knowledge of cantorial music.</p>
